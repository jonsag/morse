# morse

Morse decoding and training gadgets

## Sections

This project will (probably) consist of two parts:  

* A CW paddle keyer  
* A morse decoder  

I have no real intention with this, other than that I think it could be fun testing these things out.  

### Keyer

A keyer based on the [nanoKeyer](https://nanokeyer.wordpress.com/) by Oscar, DJ0MY.  
NanoKeyer is built on the [K3NG Arduino CW Keyer](https://github.com/k3ng/k3ng_cw_keyer) open source project by [Anthony Good](https://github.com/k3ng).  
More documentation can be found at [github](https://github.com/ra0sms/nanokeyer).  

There's also the keyer, [Iambic Keyer Using Microcontroller](https://www.instructables.com/Iambic-Keyer-Using-Microcontroller/) by [fredlam](https://www.instructables.com/member/fredlam/).  
This uses the [PIC12F675](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/pic12f675), and perhaps I will delve into this approach later on, but for now I will stick to Oscar's design.  

### Decoder

A decoder based on [Morse Code Iambic Trainer and Decoder](https://www.instructables.com/Morse-Code-Iambic-Trainer-and-Decoder/) by [scd](https://www.instructables.com/member/scd/).  

## nanoKeyer build

If you don't want to print the entire casing, Oscar recommend these parts from [reichelt](https://www.reichelt.com)

* [KOH-0100, Profile housing half-shell, 100 x 6.73 mm, individually shrink-w](https://www.reichelt.com/se/en/shop/product/profile_housing_half-shell_100_x_6_73_mm_individually_shrink-w-58238?country=se&CCTYPE=private&LANGUAGE=en)  
* [KOH-4100, Profile housing half-shell, 100 x 32.1 mm, individually shrink-w](https://www.reichelt.com/se/en/shop/product/profile_housing_half-shell_100_x_32_1_mm_individually_shrink-w-58241)  
* [DPL 1-2, Cover set for half-shell profiles, KOH 1 + 2 packaged sets, 105](https://www.reichelt.com/se/en/shop/product/cover_set_for_half-shell_profiles_koh_1_2_packaged_sets_105-58257)  
* KNOPF 17-6 A, which is an aluminium knob for the potentiometer, but I couldn't find that at reichelt.  

If you instead want to print the faceplates fitting the casing above, there are stl's for [download at thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4552149), designed by [Kaan, DL8GE](https://www.thingiverse.com/DL8GE).  

## Decoder build

## Need a key?

The excellent twin paddle CW key by [EA7HVO](https://www.thingiverse.com/EA7HVO) can be downloaded from [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4586197).  4
